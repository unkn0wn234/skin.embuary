# skin.embuary(mod) and disclaimer
Embuary is based on the web UI of Emby and has been developed for Emby-For-kodi users, but it doesn't require Emby at all and will also work with a regular Kodi setup.
      - This is not a true mod in any sense I just made very miniscule changes, Ive made it embuarymod just for those people who may want to keep their original embuary installs           and also in the case I may have messed something up.
      
# Changes Made
Added episode and season viewtypes for all addons as previously it was only for library content, embuary info/helper and select few addons such as emby and plex. Outside of this it was just lists.

# Terms of use
With the installation of the skin you agree that you don't use it in combination with blacklisted and illegal Kodi add-ons.
I'm not associated with any available build and I won't give any support to blacklisted, banned or illegal third party addons.
